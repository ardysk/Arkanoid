Arkanoid Game for FRDM-KL05Z

Overview

This project implements a classic Arkanoid game on the FRDM-KL05Z microcontroller platform. The game utilizes an OLED screen for display, a touch slider for paddle control, and a matrix keyboard for menu navigation.

Features

Dynamic Gameplay: Interactive paddle and ball control with real-time collision detection.

Menu Options: Adjust brightness, night mode, and refresh rate.

Scoring System: Real-time score updates and leaderboard display.

Game Over Screen: Displays the final score and allows restarting the game.

Power-ups: Include multiball, paddle expansion, and extra life.

Hardware Components

FRDM-KL05Z Microcontroller Board

OLED Display (SSD1306): Connected via SPI, displays game graphics.

Touch Slider (TSI): Enables paddle control with precise touch detection.

Matrix Keyboard: Used for menu navigation.

Software Structure

The software is modularized into the following components:

Core Files

main.c: Initializes peripherals and manages the main game loop.

arkanoid.c / arkanoid.h: Handles game logic, including ball movement, paddle control, block collision, and power-ups.

oled.c / oled.h: Manages the OLED display, including drawing text, shapes, and refreshing the screen.

tsi.c / tsi.h: Handles the touch slider, providing paddle position data.

spi.c / spi.h: Configures the SPI interface for OLED communication.

gpio.c / gpio.h: Provides GPIO utilities for controlling hardware components.

Additional Resources

Fonts.c / Fonts.h: Bitmap fonts and graphics used for display elements like blocks and text.

LIB_Config.h: Contains pin definitions and configuration macros.

frdm_bsp.h: Board-specific definitions and macros.

Gameplay Mechanics

Initialization:

Peripherals (SPI, OLED, TSI) are initialized.

The game starts with the paddle and ball positioned at their default locations.

Menu Navigation:

Use the matrix keyboard to select options such as starting the game or viewing scores.

Game Loop:

Control the paddle using the touch slider.

The ball interacts with blocks and the paddle, updating the score upon block destruction.

Lose a life if the ball falls below the paddle.

Game Over:

When all lives are lost, the game displays the final score.

Controls

Touch Slider: Moves the paddle horizontally.

Matrix Keyboard:

Navigate through the menu.

Input player nickname.

Build and Deployment

Requirements

IDE: MCUXpresso IDE (recommended).

SDK: NXP SDK for FRDM-KL05Z.

Programming Tool: OpenSDA or compatible flash loader.

Steps

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-repo/arkanoid.git

Open the project in MCUXpresso IDE.

Compile the project.

Flash the binary to the FRDM-KL05Z board.

Connect the hardware components as per the schematics.

Power on the board to start the game.

File Descriptions

main.c: Contains the main game loop and initializes the system.

arkanoid.c: Implements gameplay logic such as collisions, scoring, and level progression.

oled.c: Handles drawing on the OLED display.

tsi.c: Reads touch slider input for paddle control.

spi.c: Manages SPI communication with the OLED display.

gpio.c: Provides utility functions for GPIO control.

Fonts.c: Contains bitmap fonts and graphics for the game.

LIB_Config.h: Defines hardware configurations and macros.

frdm_bsp.h: Provides board-specific constants and helper functions.

Schematics

System Diagram: Connects FRDM-KL05Z, OLED, matrix keyboard, and touch slider.

Pin Configuration:

OLED:

CS: PTB6

Known Issues

Touch slider calibration may require adjustment depending on environmental factors.

Limited RAM may restrict the number of levels or complex animations.

Future Enhancements

Add more power-ups and game levels.

Implement persistent score storage using non-volatile memory.

Enhance graphics and animations.
